  "Decode and Deploy" was born from my desire to create a centralized space where I can catalog my professional experiences and share them with others, especially newcomers and trainees in bioinformatics. This blog serves as both a personal knowledge repository and a resource for those who might be struggling with similar challenges in this field.
