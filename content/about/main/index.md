  "Decode and Deploy" was born from my desire to create a centralized space where I can catalog my professional experiences and share them with others, especially newcomers and trainees in bioinformatics. This blog serves as both a personal knowledge repository and a resource for those who might be struggling with similar challenges in this field.
  
   This blog is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
